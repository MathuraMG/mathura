      <p class="project__blurb">
        <br> In collaboration with Akshay Iyer, Lisa Song and Yue Zhang
        <br> A data management app to coallate students data and analyse their progress in beat boxing. The students are visually challenged and use beat boxing as an additional aide to speech therapy.
      </p>

      <img class="project__image-medium" src="/assets/beatbox/logo.png" alt="beat box app logo"></img>

      <p>
        B.E.A.T NYC is a nonprofit organization in New York City, which operates extracurricular programs for the urban youth. One of their programs, <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://www.beatnyc.org/programs/beat-rockers/">Beat Rockers</a>,
        deals with assisting the blind and the visually impaired in speech therapy using beat boxing. As time progresses, this music becomes an enabler to new forms of expression.
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Project Pitch</h4>
      <img class="project__image" src="/assets/beatbox/beatbox_mockup.png" alt="mock up of user using the beat-box app"></img>
      <p>
        The Beat Rockers program has evolved from being just a music program to a medium that assists speech therapy. To ensure smooth communication between the Beat Rockers, the speech therapists, and the immediate family of the students, it becomes extremely
        important to track and analyze the progress of each student in a confidential manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to achieve this, we, along with the assistance of the Beat Rockers, created ‘Beat BOX’ a Database Management System that would assist the Beat Rockers, the speech therapist and all family members of a student to track and understand the student's progress. It also allows the Beat Rockers to formalize and share lesson plans easily.
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Mobile app</h4>

      <p>
        To begin with, Beat Rockers can create their own accounts and then login with the same.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen1.png" alt="sign up screen for mobile app"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen6.png" alt="login screen for mobile app"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        The default view is the list of all students. It is possible to click into a student to see more details about them and see all their recordings. There is also an option to see the students progress in specific skills.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen7.png" alt="screen showing list of all students"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen8.png" alt="screen showing details of individual students"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen2.png" alt="screen showing students progress in individual skills"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        The app contains the ability to add and edit the lesson plans.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen13.png" alt="screen showing list of all lessons"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen14.png" alt="screen showing details of individual lesson"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen15.png" alt="screen showing addition of a new lesson"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        It is also possible to classify students by the classes that they belong to.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen11.png" alt="screen showing list of all classes"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen12.png" alt="screen showing students in one of the classes"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        The users have their own profile pages where they can get notification of new recordings from the students and also see their own recordings and comments.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen3.png" alt="screen showing user profiles"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen4.png" alt="screen showing user profiles when they have new notifications"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen5.png" alt="screen showing all of the users recordings"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        Another important feature of this app is the ability to record music directly from the app. These tunes can be linked to students or to lessons.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small-outline" src="/assets/beatbox/screen9.png" alt="screen showing audio recording"></img>
        
      </div>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Project Research</h4>

      <p>
        Based on our research and feedback from our prototypes, a working model of a database management system was created and established which helped the user in simplifying the process of storing, retrieving and tracking student data. This application ensures
        data encryption and ensures that all confidential student data remains unavailable unless an authorized user enters their authentication details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keeping these functionalities required in mind, we made the below site map.
      </p>

      <img class="project__image" src="/assets/beatbox/sitemap.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>

      <p> The app was built using the following technologies</p>
      <ul class="project__list" title="project stack">
        <li>Ruby on Rails web framework</li>
        <li>Bootstrap styling</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL database </li>
        <li>Dropbox integration for file storage </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The app is currently in its beta phase with users.The projects is open sourced and the
        <a class="project__link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MathuraMG/BeatRockers">source code is viewable here</a>.
