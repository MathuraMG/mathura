        <br> Concept design of a phone app that gamifies physiotheraphy and keeps track of patients progress.
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">The Question</h4>
      <p>
        How can you ensure that patients continue with their physiotherapy without having to go to the hospital/clinic for each session ?
      </p>

      <p>
        The problems with physiotheraphy(PT) are the following -
        <ul class="project__list" title="project stack">
          <li>PT can be stressful and even painful</li>
          <li>There is a lack of motivation/delight in doing PT</li>
          <li>Most people forget to do PT regularly</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Takeaway from User testing</h4>
      <p>
        Through user testing with people from the age range of 21-65, the following was discovered
        <ul class="project__list" title="project stack">
          <li>Process itself was very dry and boring (and painful) </li>
          <li>While reminders can be annoying, they can be helpful in this case </li>
          <li>Even after the immediate pain goes away, patients need to be reminded to continue their PT</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">The Solution</h4>
      <h5 class="project__sub-heading">Assets from freepik.com</h5>
      <p>
        Based on the idea of travelling the world (in 80 days), this phone app will help and remind patients to complete PT  and tries to gamify the experience. It can also keep track of a patient's progress and trigger reminders when needed.

        Doctors and patients form a PT plan together.
      </p>
      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset3.png" alt="screen before adding exercises"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset4.png" alt="screen before adding exercises"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset5.png" alt="screen showing all exercises"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        The plan contains the list of exercises and the number of days to do them.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset6.png" alt="screen showing selected exercises."></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset7.png" alt="screen showing number of days of PT required"></img>
      </div>
      <p>
        The patient gets a "travel plan". Each day of exercise helps them progress to the next location.
      </p>
      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset13.png" alt="screen showing the travel plan"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        Every day they start their exercise in a new location. The users strap their phone onto their body and the app tracks the basic motion. The app alerts you after the duration of exercise has elapsed.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset9.png" alt="screen at the beginning of a given day in a new location"></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundTheWorld/Asset10.png" alt="screen shown during exercise"></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        On completion of the day's exercise, the user moves on to the next city.
      </p>
