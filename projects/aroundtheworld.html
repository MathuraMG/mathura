      <p class="project__blurb">
        <br> Concept design of a phone app that gamifies physiotheraphy and keeps track of patients progress.
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">The Question</h4>
      <p>
        How can you ensure that patients continue with their physiotherapy without having to go to the hospital/clinic for each session ?
      </p>

      <p>
        The problems with physiotheraphy(PT) are the following -
        <ul class="project__list" title="project stack">
          <li>PT can be stressful and even painful</li>
          <li>There in a lack of motivation/delight in doing PT</li>
          <li>Most people forget to do PT regularly</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Takeaway from User testing</h4>
      <p>
        Through user testing with people from the age range of 21-65, below were the takeaways
        <ul class="project__list" title="project stack">
          <li>Process itself was very dry and boring ( and painful ) </li>
          <li>While reminders can be annoying they can be helpful in this case </li>
          <li>Even after the immediate pain goes away, patients need to be reminded to continue their PT</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">The Solution</h4>
      <p>
        Based on the idea of travelling the world ( in 80 days ), this phone app - Will help and remind patients to complete PT Tries to gamify the experience Could also help keep track of patient's progress and trigger reminders if needed

      <p>
        Doctors and patients together form the plan
      </p>
      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset3.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset4.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset5.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        The plan contains the list of exercises and the number of days to do them.
      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset6.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset7.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
      </div>
      <p>
        Patient then gets a “travel plan” Each day of exercise helps them progress and go to the next location
      </p>
      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset13.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        Every day they start their exercise in a new location User straps phone onto leg and app tracks basic motion Alerts you after duration of exercise Can do exercises in parts - it will remind you at regular intervals through the day Plays music/videos to
        help take away some boredom

      </p>

      <div class="project__image-small-container">
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset9.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
        <img class="project__image-small" src="/assets/aroundtheWorld/Asset10.png" alt="speakers used for experimenting with a bag containing pyrocystis placed on top."></img>
      </div>

      <p>
        On completion of the days exercise you move on to the next city.
