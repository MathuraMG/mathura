        "Cat In A Box" is an educational book-box series that teaches children the basics of science and electronics via storytelling.
        The aim of this book is to kindle curiosity and enable empowerment. Its design merges form and function to promote the curiosity of knowledge you are seeking to unlock.

        Cat in a box is an educational book-box series that teaches children the basics of science and electronics via physical storytelling.

      <p>
        The stories in this series follow the adventures of CAT – a cat that lives at home usually without people. The first story, “House in the Dark”, involves fixing the lights in the house where CAT lives. As the user helps fix the lights, they learn about what circuits and electricity are. The book is also strewn with fun facts about electricity that encourage curiosity.

        This structure of the book-box is highly inspired by the Rajasthani storytelling art, Kavaad. It is a box structure that opens to reveal pictures of episodes in a particular story. This structure encourages the spirit of inquiry as it requires the user to search for the next page and additional information. The final product provides a complete experience for the user in terms of information, physical interactions and visual language.

        This project is primarily meant for an audience that is between the ages of 6 and 10. It aims to create an engaging learning tool that moves away from the digital and towards the tangible. This is meant as a tool to supplement learning in classroom or museum type spaces.
        <br><br>
        The inspiration for this project stems form my own curiosity. As an electronics engineer myself, I was interested to explore different ways of teaching the same information to people who have not been introduced to electronics previously. I am also very interested in exploring how we can introduce traditional forms of story telling in modern education.
