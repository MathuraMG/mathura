        An exploration to see if it possible to create <b>rich educational experiences</b> that are based on traditional forms of <b>Indian storytelling</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
          This thesis project is strongly inspired by <b>Kavaad</b> which is a rich form of storytelling that originates in Rajasthan, India. It is a box structure that opens to reveal pictures of episodes in a particular story, or more frequently in a series of stories about a particular character

      </p>

      <img class="project__image" src="/assets/thesis/kavaad.png"
      alt="kavaad in many stages"></img>

      <p>
        My thesis revolves around the idea of combining this with todayâ€™s education. For instance, use this form and structure to say a story about physics, electronics etc.
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Why is this needed ?</h4>
      <ul class="project__list" title="why is this needed">
        <li>To create an engaging learning tool that moves away from the digital and towards the tangiable</li>
        <li>To encourage learning through puzzles and games</li>
        <li>(In the long run) Make this a low cost and open source tool that can be easily used by teachers and parents</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Audience</h4>
      <p>
        This is primarily meant for kids who are beginning to learn electronics/physics (between the age of 6 - 10). Another audience this would be useful to is adults who are interested in learning new concepts in a fun and engaging way.
      </p>

      <h4 class="project__content-heading">Progress</h4>
      <p>
        Below is a storyboard prototype for the first box. It's a story that helps the user learn about simple circuits.
        Here the user gets a box with a story and a little exercise in each page. Each exercise involves plugging in components that will help complete the circuit that is mentioned in the story.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below are more possible prototypes of induvidual pages.
        In this example, once the user puts the button and the light in the circuit and will see the light turn on in the circuit as well as in the porch.
      </p>
      <img class="project__image" src="/assets/thesis/page2.png"></img>
      <p>
        In the below prototype, the switch and the light are placed where they would be in the house. On turning it one, one can lift up the top panel to see how the circuit actually works.
      </p>

      <p> This project is still a work in progress this page contains updates as of March 1st 2017 </p>
